Gulp is an automation tool for web dev. It minify the css and js files, give you warning / errors for the js compilation, watch the changes in the code and sync the browser, etc. A dist directory will be created and contains everything you need to deploy to server.

Once you are ready to build, go to the confusion directory
- gulp watch
	//or just run gulp, if you do not want to watch the code change and sync the browser

My json-server directory is at the same level as app directory, the same as dist directory. Once the gulp watch is running:
- copy all the contents in dist directory to json-server/public folder
- json-server --watch db.json
	//this will start the json server, the js files in public directory will fetch data from the server
- http://localhost:3000
	//type this in browser, to access the contents
